# Cognix: Trade with Intelligence

An intelligent trading system that combines natural language algorithm creation, multi-agent analysis, and automated execution on Hyperliquid DEX with bridging capabilities via Avail Nexus.

## 🌟 Overview

This platform revolutionizes algorithmic trading by allowing users to create trading strategies in natural language, validate them through backtesting, and execute them via an intelligent multi-agent system that performs comprehensive technical and sentiment analysis before placing trades.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Components

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Algorithm Creation
- Create trading algorithms using plain English
- No coding required - describe your strategy naturally
- Automatic conversion to executable trading logic
- Support for complex conditions and multi-indicator strategies

### 2. Intelligent Backtesting
- Automatic backtesting upon algorithm creation
- Historical performance metrics and visualizations
- Risk-adjusted returns analysis
- User approval workflow before live deployment

### 3. Multi-Agent Intelligence System
The platform employs a sophisticated agentic architecture:

#### **Supervisor Agent**
- Orchestrates communication between specialist agents
- Makes final trading decisions based on consensus
- Manages workflow and prioritization

#### **Technical Agent**
- Access to 200+ technical indicators via TAAPI.io
- Multi-timeframe analysis
- Support for any trading interval
- Advanced pattern recognition

#### **Sentiment Agent**
- Real-time news sentiment analysis
- Google News API integration
- ML-based sentiment scoring
- Market mood assessment

#### **Trading Agent**
- Custom algorithms for stop-loss identification
- Take-profit level calculation
- Support/resistance analysis
- Risk-to-reward optimization

#### **Web Search Agent**
- General information retrieval
- Market context gathering
- Event-driven intelligence

### 4. Configurable Agent Behavior
- Customize analysis parameters
- Enable/disable specific agents (e.g., sentiment-only analysis)
- Fine-tune risk tolerance
- Set custom approval thresholds

### 5. Secure Fund Management
- API wallet system - users retain full custody
- API wallets cannot withdraw user funds
- Execution-only permissions
- JWT-based authentication via Privy

### 6. Seamless Asset Bridging
- Avail Nexus SDK integration
- Direct deposit to Hyperliquid in single flow
- Cross-chain asset management

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Bridge Integration**: Avail Nexus SDK
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets
- **Authentication**: Privy wallet connection

### Execution Engine

## 📊 How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Algorithm Creation**
```
   User describes strategy → NLP processing → Algorithm generated
```

2. **Validation Phase**
```
   Auto-backtesting → Performance metrics → User reviews → Approval
```

3. **Live Monitoring**
```
   Real-time market data → Algorithm evaluation → Signal generation
```

4. **Intelligent Execution**
```
   Signal triggered → Agentic team analysis → Multi-factor validation → Trade execution
```

### Decision Making Process

Unlike traditional bots that execute trades automatically when conditions are met, this platform:

1. **Receives Signal**: Algorithm conditions are met
2. **Triggers Analysis**: Supervisor agent activates specialist agents
3. **Multi-Factor Analysis**:
   - Technical indicators across timeframes
   - Current market sentiment
   - Support/resistance levels
   - Risk-to-reward assessment
4. **Consensus Building**: Agents collaborate and vote
5. **Execution**: Trade placed only if all factors favor the signal

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Non-custodial Design**: Users maintain full control of funds
- **API Wallet Isolation**: Trading wallets have execution-only permissions
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure session management
- **Private Key Management**: Keys never exposed to backend

## 📈 Use Cases

- **Trend Following**: Create strategies based on moving averages and momentum
- **Mean Reversion**: Identify overbought/oversold conditions
- **Sentiment Trading**: Execute based on news and social sentiment
- **Multi-Factor Strategies**: Combine technical, fundamental, and sentiment signals
- **Risk-Managed Trading**: Automated stop-loss and take-profit management

## 🎯 Competitive Advantages

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Democratizes algorithmic trading
2. **AI-Powered Validation**: Reduces false signals through multi-agent consensus
3. **Customizable Intelligence**: Users control agent behavior and analysis depth
4. **Seamless Onboarding**: Integrated bridging eliminates cross-chain friction
5. **Non-Custodial Security**: Users never sacrifice fund control
